## Welcome to the Liao Research Lab!

Chen Liao is an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Microbiology and Immunology](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/microbio/), [GEISEL School of Medicine at Dartmouth College](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu). He completed his B.S. in Physics at the University of Science and Technology of China in 2010. He developed a strong interest in synthetic biology and earned his Ph.D. in Bioengineering under the mentorship of [Dr. Ting Lu](https://lulab.bioen.illinois.edu) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 2018, Chen joined the lab of [Dr. Joao Xavier](https://xavierlab.org) at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center as a postdoc, where he was co-mentored by [Dr. Tobias Hohl](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/tobias-hohl).

The Liao Lab is a hybrid research group that combines computational modeling, experimental microbiology, and clinical data analysis to investigate microbial metabolism within the human gut microbiome. Our work focuses on deciphering the complex metabolite-mediated interactions between microbes and their human host. Our long-term goals are to (1) elucidate the metabolic pathways linking intestinal microbiota to human health, and (2) develop computational platforms that enable the rational design of microbiome-based therapies.
