## Direction 1: Metabolic regulation of fungal pathogenesis
Fungal pathogens survive, adapt, and cause disease in hostile host environment by rapidly reprogramming their metabolism. Accurate quantification of how intracellular reaction rates change during host interaction is
essential for understanding how metabolic reprogramming drives pathogenesis and identifying metabolic targets that inform antimicrobial therapeutic development. Our project aims to develop **an automated, genome-scale fluxomics platform that converts raw gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/LC-MS) data from isotope tracing experiments into metabolic flux maps**. This platform will transform infectious disease research and systems biology by enabling routine, high-resolution analysis of microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions. Using this technology, we will investigate clinically relevant questions such as how *Candida albicans* rewires its metabolism during the pathogenic yeast-to-hyphae transition and how these metabolic adaptations contribute to gut colonization and drug resistance.

## Direction 2: Metabolic cross-feeding in the gut microbiome
We aim to develop novel computational models, including kinetic, constraint-based, and machine learning approaches, to infer metabolic activities within the human gut microbiome. Rather than focusing solely on metabolite levels, our goal is to understand the dynamic metabolic behavior of individual microbes and quantify metabolite exchange fluxes between them. Specifically, we ask: **given multi-omics microbiota data, can we determine which microbes are producing or consuming specific metabolites, and how these activities change over time?** To address this, we will integrate metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics data with community-level metabolic models to infer metabolite uptake and secretion for each microbe. We also plan to expand these models by incorporating spatial effects and water flow dynamics towards a 3D biophysical model. By predicting these microbial metabolic activities, we can map interactions such as nutrient competition and cross-feeding that are difficult to measure experimentally. This approach provides a new lens for understanding microbial dysbiosis, revealing altered metabolic functions in conditions such as cystic fibrosis beyond what can be inferred from metabolite levels alone.

## Direction 3: Host-microbiome interactions in colorectal cancer
The gut microbiome plays a key role in shaping the immune system and can influence success of cancer immunotherapies, yet the mechanisms remain largely unknown. In our lab, we investigate how specific microbial communities modulate anti-tumor immunity in colorectal cancer. Using gnotobiotic mouse models, we manipulate the microbiome and track the resulting changes in immune cell populations and cytokine profiles within tumors. Beyond mouse models, we are developing host-microbe co-culture *in vitro* systems and applying isotope tracing to identify metabolic crosstalk between microbes and host cells. We combine these experiments with mathematical modeling to simulate host-microbiome interactions and predict which microbes enhance or suppress immunotherapy responses. By integrating experimental and computational approaches, we aim to uncover fundamental principles of microbiome-immune interactions and design a computational tool to faciliate the rationale design of microbiome-based therapies.
