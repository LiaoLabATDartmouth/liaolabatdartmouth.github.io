## Direction 1: Metabolic regulation of fungal pathogenesis
Fungal pathogens survive and thrive in hostile host environments by rapidly reprogramming their metabolism. While advances in transcriptomics and metabolomics have transformed our ability to profile cellular states, directly measuring metabolism remains challenging due to the complexity and dynamic nature of reaction fluxes. Accurate, genome-scale quantification of metabolic fluxes could revolutionize the study of infections and uncover new targets for antimicrobial therapies. Our project aims to develop the first fully automated, genome-scale platform that converts raw gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/LC-MS) data from isotope tracing experiments into comprehensive metabolic flux maps. This platform will transform infectious disease research and systems biology by enabling routine, high-resolution analysis of microbial and host metabolic dynamics. Using this technology, we will investigate clinically relevant questions such as how Candida albicans rewires its metabolism during the pathogenic yeast-to-hyphae transition and how these metabolic adaptations contribute to gut colonization and drug resistance.

## Direction 2: Metabolic cross-feeding in the gut microbiome
We aim to develop novel computational models, including kinetic, constraint-based, and machine learning approaches, to infer metabolic activities within the human gut microbiome. Rather than focusing solely on overall fecal metabolite levels, our goal is to understand the dynamic metabolic behavior of individual microbes. Specifically, we ask: given multi-omics microbiota data, can we determine which microbes are producing or consuming specific metabolites, and how these activities change over time? To address this, we will integrate metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics data with community-level metabolic models to infer metabolite uptake and secretion for each microbe. We also plan to expand these models by incorporating spatial effects and water flow dynamics. By predicting these microbial metabolic activities, we can map interactions such as nutrient competition and cross-feeding that are difficult to measure experimentally. This approach provides a new lens for understanding microbial dysbiosis, revealing altered metabolic functions in conditions such as cystic fibrosis beyond what can be inferred from metabolite levels alone.

## Direction 3: Host-microbiome interactions in colorectal cancer
The gut microbiome plays a key role in shaping the immune system and can influence the success of cancer immunotherapies, yet the mechanisms remain largely unknown. In our lab, we investigate how specific microbial communities modulate anti-tumor immunity in colorectal cancer. Using gnotobiotic mouse models, we manipulate the microbiome and track the resulting changes in immune cell populations and cytokine profiles within tumors. Beyond mouse models, we are developing host-microbe co-culture in vitro systems and applying isotope tracing to identify metabolic crosstalk between microbes and host cells. We combine these experiments with mathematical modeling to simulate host-microbiome interactions and predict which microbes enhance or suppress immunotherapy responses. By integrating experimental and computational approaches, we aim to uncover fundamental principles of microbiome-immune interactions and inform the design of microbiome-based therapies. Trainees in the lab gain hands-on experience in cutting-edge microbiome research, immunology assays, and computational modeling within a collaborative and interdisciplinary environment.
