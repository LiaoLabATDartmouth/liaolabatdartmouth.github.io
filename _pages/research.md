      We study microbial metabolism using metabolomics and isotope tracing to quantify metabolic fluxes across scales — from intracellular pathway activity to cross-feeding in multispecies communities. Our goal is to develop experimental and computational approaches that expand flux coverage while making flux quantification as accessible and routine as possible. A major focus of the lab is fungal pathogens. In <em>Candida albicans</em>, we investigate how metabolism is rewired during the transition between yeast and hyphal growth. In <em>Aspergillus fumigatus</em>, we study metabolic reprogramming during biofilm growth, with a particular emphasis on the spatiotemporal distribution of metabolites and fluxes. Beyond metabolomics, we are building a 3D biophysical modeling platform that integrates hyphal growth simulations with genome-scale metabolic modeling to infer spatially resolved metabolic activity within biofilm structures. Ultimately, we aim to link fungal metabolic states to clinically relevant phenotypes, including morphogenesis, biofilm architecture, antifungal resistance, and virulence, and to translate these insights into new metabolism-targeted antifungal therapies.

      We develop experimental and computational approaches to understand and predict how the gut microbiome responds to external perturbations and how the host responds to microbiome changes. In particular, we investigate how microbiome composition and function shape host immunity and modulate responses to cancer immunotherapy. Our preliminary data show that gut colonization by Bacteroides spp. reduces colorectal tumor growth in mice, motivating mechanistic questions about how their colonization alters host immune programs and metabolism. We study these interactions using complementary in vitro, in vivo, and in silico models. We use co-culture platforms (e.g., transwell systems) and isotope tracing to track metabolite flow between Bacteroides spp. and tumor cells or host immune cells, and we collect single-cell, spatial transcriptomics, and spatial metabolomics data from mouse tissues to quantify host responses in the tumor microenvironment. These measurements are integrated with statistical and mechanistic modeling, including models of immune cell population dynamics and microbiome–immune regulation, to identify microbes, metabolites, and metabolic pathways that enhance or suppress anti-tumor immunity. Ultimately, we aim to identify gut-derived molecules (e.g., metabolites) that regulate host responses and use these insights to faciliate rational design of microbiome-based therapies.
